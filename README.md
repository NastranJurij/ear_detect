# ear_detect
This is a repository with my solution to the 2. assignment of Image Based Biometry course

Because uploading images to github is a bad practice, I have decided to upload only the classifier and the code that classifies the test images using the classifier.

**IMPORTANT WHEN DOWNLOADING THE CODE:**

The same folder that contains the python file **ear_detection.py** and folder **classifier** should also contain the folder **test** with the same test images as were given at the start of the 2. assignment. It should also contain the folder **testannot_rect** with the same annotated test images as were given at the start of the 2. assignment. It should also contain a newly created **empty** folder named **test_Results**. This folder will contain the resulting images when the python file  **ear_detection.py** is ran.


For any additional questions, feel free to contact me using the e-mail **jn2279@student.uni-lj.si**. Thank you.
